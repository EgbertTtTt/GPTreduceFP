METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

       solidity.performance.array-length-outside-loop                           
          Caching the array length outside a loop saves reading it on each      
  iteration, as long as the                                                     
          array's length is not changed during the loop.

          Uninitialized variables are assigned with the types default value.    
  Explicitly initializing a                                                     
          variable with its default value costs unnecessary gas.

       solidity.performance.state-variable-read-in-a-loop                       
          Replace state variable reads and writes within loops with local       
  variable reads and writes.

       solidity.performance.unnecessary-checked-arithmetic-in-loop              
          A lot of times there is no risk that the loop counter can overflow.   
  Using Solidity's                                                              
          unchecked block saves the overflow checks.

       solidity.performance.use-multiple-require                                
          Using multiple require statements is cheaper than using && multiple   
  check combinations.                                                           
          There are more advantages, such as easier to read code and better     
  coverage reports.

       solidity.performance.use-prefix-increment-not-postfix                    
          Consider using the prefix increment expression whenever the return    
  value is not needed. The                                                      
          prefix increment expression is cheaper in terms of gas.
