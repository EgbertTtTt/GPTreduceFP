METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

          Consider using custom errors as they are more gas efficient while     
  allowing developers  to                                                       
          describe the error in detail using NatSpec.
