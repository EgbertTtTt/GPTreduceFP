METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

          Caching the array length outside a loop saves reading it on each      
  iteration, as long as the

          A lot of times there is no risk that the loop counter can overflow.   
  Using Solidity's

          Consider using the prefix increment expression whenever the return    
  value is not needed. The
