METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

          Uninitialized variables are assigned with the types default value.    
  Explicitly initializing a                                                     
          variable with its default value costs unnecessary gas.

          Using multiple require statements is cheaper than using && multiple

          There are more advantages, such as easier to read code and better
